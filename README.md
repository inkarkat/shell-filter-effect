# Shell Filter Effect

_Commands that perform some kind of action, often based on [the availability of] output piped into them, or the result of a command execution._

### Dependencies

* Bash, GNU `awk`, GNU `sed`
* automated testing is done with _bats - Bash Automated Testing System_ (https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core)

### Installation

* The `./bin` subdirectory is supposed to be added to `PATH`.
* The [shell/completions.sh](shell/completions.sh) script (meant to be sourced in `.bashrc`) defines Bash completions for the provided commands.
* The [profile/exports.sh](profile/exports.sh) sets up configuration; it only needs to be sourced once, e.g. from your `.profile`.
