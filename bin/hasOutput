    --non-whitespace|-w	Output that does not contain at least one non-whitespace
			character is treated like no output and causes the
			command to fail.
    --abort|-X		Don't slurp in all remaining output, but abort early.
			Note: This can cause the output command to fail with a
			"broken pipe" error, but if you suppress standard error
			and don't have "pipefail" set, this can avoid
			unnecessary computation.
EXIT STATUS:
    0	Output has been read and suppressed.
    1	No output received.
    2	Bad invocation, wrong or missing command-line arguments.
